# ATM-Card-Validation-Project

## Introduction:
This project is a simple C++ program to validate an ATM card number using the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. The program takes an ATM card number as input and checks if it is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.

## Features:
- ATM Card Validation: The core feature of the program is to check if an entered ATM card number is valid.
- Luhn Algorithm Implementation: The program implements the Luhn algorithm to perform the validation.
- User Input: The program prompts the user to enter an ATM card number.
- Output: The program provides clear output indicating whether the entered card number is valid or not.
